# "Phase 3" from the Stackbit tutorial:  Make Fast, Versatile Themes with Page Builder Components

Explore this codebase, [see an example](https://kkwsb-components-phase3.netlify.app), then [turn this theme into a web site with Stackbit](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/kkwsb/components-phase3) edit it in real time.  Try any of these ideas:

* Add pages
* Add, remove, edit, and reorder sections
* Add, remove, edit, and reorder actions and cards

## Takeaway

When you incorporate **lists of visual components** into your content model, you empower end users to unlock the full power of a Jamstack-ready interactive editing tool like Stackbit -- and through it, the full power of their creativity.
